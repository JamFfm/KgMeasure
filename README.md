# KgMeasure
Project to build a wireless Scale for CraftbeerPi3 to Measure the weight of a kettle.

Data is send by Mqtt and you can use the CBPi3 Mqtt addon to receive the data

This item measures the weight during brewing prozess. 

It it useful to fill in the water, the malt, to see how many water is evaporated while cooking the hops.
The addon works with Mqtt so you can implement this item to other Mqtt based projects.

The main idea is from this german side https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2018/2/1515450954216728
